# Kvell D Agent

A small Python-based chatbot agent that wires a language model to a state graph and optional tools. The project uses the files under `src/` and is runnable locally.
ble (for example, when running in certain environments), `main.py` includes a fallback message and exits after one loop.

## Setup

1. Python 3.13.5
2. Install uv 
3. ```uv install -r requirements.txt```

## Running the Agent
```python src/main.py```
